### In neuroscience, one of the most important objectives in recent decades has been to rehabilitate people who no longer have a functioning connection between their mind and their body. A brain computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery can detect the EEG patterns of various imagined motions, such as right or left hand movement. It allows for entirely non-muscular communication.
### This is already being done effectively using costly, medical grade EEG gear, but owing to the high cost, it has not yet reached the commercial market. In this project, I investigate about how low-cost EEG hardware in a BCI, can be implemented, in a proof-of-concept manner. As a result, I used state of the art feature extraction and categorization techniques. Using CSP for feature extraction and LDA as classifier.
### BCIs are communication systems that seek to provide people with an alternative control input to computers. Changes in brain signal modulation are detected by BCIs and translated into control instructions. Electroencephalography (EEG) is now used as the primary acquisition technique for BCI. The obtained EEG signal is a macroscopic assessment of neuronal activity in the brain, which is mediated by a layer of bone, tissue, and fluid. As a result, EEG has poor spatial resolution, and the signal collection through surface electrodes makes EEG vulnerable to interference from a number of sources, including bodily movement, power line noise, and other electronic equipment.
### Despite the increasing attention that BCI technology has received with the introduction of low-cost commercial EEG devices in recent years, BCIs are seldom utilised outside of the laboratory setting. This is mostly because existing BCI systems lack reliability and performance when compared to other kinds of interfaces. MI-BCI, for example, requires lengthy training trials each session, and the parameters are subject-specific. As a result, these lengthy and repeated training sessions may cause user fatigue and deterioration in performance over time. Furthermore, extended training is difficult in producing EEG oscillatory rhythms regulated during MI, such as mu (μ) and beta (β). To address these problems, previous BCI research has looked at different methods for developing novel experimental designs, specialised algorithms, and signal processing techniques that reduce the existing limits of EEG-based BCIs.
### This project is based on these previous finding, to build  machine learning models that can help accurately classifier hands and feet movement. To make the work easier, this project will assume both left and right hand movement as one, and both left and right foot movement as one. Also, the data set corporated into this project is semi-preprocessed, which will help speed up the process.
